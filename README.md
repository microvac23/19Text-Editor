# 19Text-Editor

## User Story

As a developer...
* I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
* So that I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a text editor web application...
* When I open my application in my editor, then I should see a client server folder structure.
* When I run `npm run start` from the root directory, then I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.
* When I run the text editor application from my terminal, then I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
* When I run my webpack plugins, then I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
* When I use next-gen JavaScript in my application, then I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
* When I open the text editor, then I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
* When I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window, then I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
* When I reopen the text editor after closing it, then I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
* When I click on the Install button, then I download my web application as an icon on my desktop.
* When I load my web application, then I should have a registered service worker using workbox.
* When I register a service worker, then I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
* When I deploy to Heroku, then I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
